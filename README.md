## Skills

#### Able communicator
Communication is an important still in any profession - even more so for developers, acting as translators between the technical and the not so technical.

In my previous role, I was the primary contact for over 40 corporate clients, a key part of maintaining those relationships was acting as **technical translator**. The technical side of my job was producing complex tax analysis and calculations, but of equal importance was being able to communicate my conclusions clearly to company stakeholders outside of the financial circle.


#### Quick and curious learner
Knowing that I don't know something excites me - I see the as unfamiliar as a challenge. During my time at Makers Academy, eagerness to move out of my comfort zone has pushed me to discover new technologies in very short timeframes:

- After being introduced to **Javascript** on the Monday, I had built a small thermostat app by the Friday, integrating an external API using **Ajax**

- The following week, I  built an app using **Node.js** and **Express**, technologies which are not taught on the course.

- By the next Friday, we had developed an app using no frameworks at all - building our own **JQuery**-type library and fully abstractable testing suite.

Reverting back to **Ruby** and building an app in **Ruby on Rails** the following week was relatively simple by comparison!

#### Analytical problem-solver
For my degree, I focussed mainly on pure Mathematics, discovering a love for analytical, proof-based disciples. I excelled in subjects such as Complex Analysis, Logic and Maths by Computer - using **Matlab** to perform numerical analysis.

My years as a tax adviser also played to my analytic strength - preparing me for life as a developer. For my most recent project, I was responsible for analysing and modelling the tax effect of mis-sold financial products for a large high-street bank. My calculations had to take into account complex tax structures, and needed to stand up to legal scrutiny, being reviewed by independent financial regulators.


#### Keen mentor
Ever since I was a child, I've known I love to learn. What I've discovered as I've grown is that I also love to help other learn.

Whilst still an associate in my previous job, I was offered the opportunity to be a **people manager** to two recent graduates, a role normally reserved for managers and above. I enjoyed mentoring so much that I have actively sought out this role, most recently at Makers Academy.
