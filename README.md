I'm Abigail - **aspiring developer, maths geek and knitting demon**. After graduating from university with a first-class degree in **Mathematics**, I ignored my wise tutor's warnings and sold my soul to the devil - I became an accountant.

It took me three and a half years to concede that he may have been onto something. I realised I needed to leave behind the life of tax legislation and propel myself head first into the whirlwind world of coding.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp, I'm now looking for a **Full Stack Junior Developer** role in a vibrant company, somewhere where I can continue to learn and develop, working on a range of challenges and a variety of new technologies.

## Skills

#### Able communicator
Communication is an important still in any profession - even more so for developers, who in addition to possessing the technical skills, should be adept in translating these concepts for less technical types.

In my previous role, I was the primary contact for over 40 corporate clients. A key part of developing and maintaining those relationships was **technical translation**. The technical side of my job involved producing complex tax analysis and calculations, but of equal importance was being able to communicate my conclusions clearly to company stakeholders outside of the financial world.

#### Quick and curious learner
Knowing that I don't know something excites me - I see the unfamiliar as a challenge. During my time at Makers Academy, eagerness to move out of my comfort zone has pushed me to discover new technologies in very short timeframes:

- After being introduced to **Javascript** on the Monday, I had built a small thermostat app by the Friday, integrating an external API using **Ajax**
- The following week, I  built an app using **Node.js** and **Express**, technologies which are not taught on the course.
- By the next Friday, we had developed an app using no frameworks at all - building our own **JQuery**-type library and fully abstractable testing suite.

Reverting back to **Ruby** and building an app in **Rails** the following week was relatively simple by comparison!

#### Analytical problem-solver
For my degree, I focussed mainly on pure Mathematics, discovering a love for analytical, proof-based disciples. I excelled in subjects such as Complex Analysis, Logic and Maths by Computer - using **Matlab** to perform numerical analysis.

My years as a tax adviser also played to my analytic strength - preparing me for life as a developer. In my last project, I was responsible for analysing and modelling the tax effect of mis-sold financial products for a large high-street bank. My calculations had to take into account complex tax structures, and needed to stand up to legal scrutiny, being reviewed by independent financial regulators.

## Interests

**Travel** - Much to the distaste of my mother, I love to travel. Earlier this year, I took six months off to travel, two months of which I spent zigzagging the length of Vietnam on a rusty old motorbike - and survived.

**Knitting** - In particular, knitting scientifically accurate viruses, bacteria and cells in plushy form. Doesn't everyone?
